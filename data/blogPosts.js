  //     <p>Starting out in IT was daunting, but itâ€™s a field that rewards persistence. It is also a field the requires persistence. "You better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone." - Bob Dylan. These lyrics resonant with me in my day to day life but they are especially true in the tech field. Technology changes every single day and if you fail to keep up with it then you may be leaving yourseld behind. I learned this relativly fast after completing my web development bootcamp. I was taught everything I needed to know in order to make a functional CRUD application, but the rest was up to me. It was up to me to learn different methods of hosting a database, learn python, explore more JS libraries, etc. Most importantly though, it was up to me to figure out the ebbs and flows of the tech industry. Not many people can prepare you for that. You sort of have to 'go with the flow' to really get a grasp on things. Doubt never got anyone anywhere. - Aj Seadler  </p>
