          Hi there! I'm <strong>Anthony Seadler</strong>, though most people
          call me AJ. I'm a full-stack developer with a Web Development
          certificate from the University of Oklahoma and Fullstack Academy.
          Currently, I’m pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity at
          Southern Nazarene University, combining my development experience with
          a strong focus on security.
        </p>
        <p>
          With experience in backend and frontend practices, I bring a keen eye
          for design and functionality, aiming to make UX as friendly as
          possible. Take a look at some of my projects below!
