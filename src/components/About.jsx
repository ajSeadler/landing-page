          Hi there! I'm <strong>Anthony Seadler</strong>, though most people
          call me AJ. I'm a full-stack developer with a Web Development
          certification from the University of Oklahoma and Fullstack Academy.
          Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity at
          Southern Nazarene University, combining my passion for development
          with a strong focus on security.

          With experience in backend and frontend technologies, I bring a keen
          eye for design and functionality, aiming to make UX as seamless as
